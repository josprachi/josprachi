# 👋 Hi, I'm Prachi Joshi

I'm a developer with 10+ years of experience in software and game development, currently transitioning into building developer tools, open-source infrastructure, and backend systems. My work has spanned game engines, full-stack applications, and automation scripts. I believe in solving problems that help other developers create faster, cleaner, and more ethically aware software.

## 🔭 Current Focus
- Building a **browser-first game engine in C++** (in progress)
- Contributing to **open-source platforms** and localization projects (elementary OS, Tor)
- Exploring the intersection of **tech + law + cybersecurity** (currently pursuing LLB)

## 🛠️ Technologies & Tools
- Languages: `C++`, `Python`, `JavaScript`
- Tools: `Firebase`, `Godot`, `React Native`, `VS Code`, `Linux`
- Dev Areas: Game Tools, Backend APIs, Open Source Contributions, CI Workflows

## 🚀 Featured Projects
- **[josprachi/game-engine]** – Early-stage browser-first game engine (C++) (a private repository right now)
- **Open Source Localization** – Contributed to multiple platforms in Marathi and Hindi
- **Scripts & Utilities** – Firebase integrations, Python automations, experimental dev tools

## 🧠 Philosophy
Build things that help others build. Learn in public. Share the process—not just the output.
